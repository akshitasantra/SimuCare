# SimuCare

**Interactive EMT Training Simulator** built in Python/Tkinter.

SimuCare guides EMT students through timed, vitals‑driven scenarios. Users make real‑time decisions (e.g., administer epinephrine, apply oxygen) and immediately see feedback on patient vitals and their own performance.

##  Features

- **15‑minute global timer** simulating real scene urgency  
- **Vitals graph** (HR & SpO₂) updating each second via Matplotlib  
- **Step‑by‑step decision prompts** (choose intervention → confirm)  
- **Immediate feedback** on correctness plus vitals impact  
- **Action log** with timestamps, choices, and results  
- **Performance scoring**: accuracy %, average response time  
- **Modular architecture**: scenario engine, vitals simulator, action handler, scoring
